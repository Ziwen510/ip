<!--
    SuppressionFilter can suppress any audit event.

    Suppression is done via one of the following approaches:
    1. suppress a specific audit event
       - by checks attribute of a suppress tag
       - by message attribute of a suppress tag
       - by checks and message attribute of a suppress tag
    2. suppress all audit events for a file
       - by files attribute of a suppress tag
       - by files and checks attribute of a suppress tag
    3. suppress all audit events in a common module
       - by module attribute of a suppress tag

    SuppressionFilter is optional, if it is not configured, then
    no suppressions are applied.

    If you want to suppress Checkstyle violations, you can use one of the following approaches.
    Each of the approaches has its own pros and cons.

    Note: suppress and suppress-xpath are independent of each other, it is possible to
    use both at the same time. All suppress and suppress-xpath elements are handled
    together as a set, regardless of whether they are defined in the same file or
    in the separate files.

    Example of a suppress tag:
    <suppress files="[a-zA-Z]*Test\.java" checks="MagicNumber"/>

    This suppresses Magic Number violations in all files that match the
    regular expression [a-zA-Z]*Test\.java.

    Example of a suppress-xpath tag:
    <suppress-xpath checks="DescendantToken"
                    query="//METHOD_DEF[./IDENT[@text='start']]//ASSIGN[@text='=']"/>

    This suppresses DescendantToken violations in all files for any assignment
    tokens that are descendants of a method with the name "start".
